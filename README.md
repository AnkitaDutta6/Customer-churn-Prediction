## ðŸ“– Overview
This project aims to develop machine learning models to predict customer churn using the Telco Customer Churn dataset. The project follows a full ML pipeline: data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, model building, hyperparameter tuning, and evaluation.

---

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset
- **Dataset Name**: Telco Customer Churn
- **Source**: [Kaggle Dataset Link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/blastchar/telco-customer-churn)

Features include:
- Customer demographics (gender, senior citizen status, etc.)
- Services signed up for (internet, online security, etc.)
- Account information (contract type, payment method, monthly charges, etc.)
- Target variable: `Churn` (Yes/No)

---

## ðŸ“› Problem Statement
**Business Problem**: Predict whether a customer will churn based on their demographics and services subscribed, helping the business retain customers.

---

## ðŸ›  Approach
1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Handled missing values.
   - Encoded categorical variables.
   - Scaled numerical features.
   - Dropped irrelevant features like `customerID`.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Visualized churn rates.
   - Analyzed feature distributions.
   - Generated correlation heatmaps.

3. **Model Building**
   - Trained baseline Logistic Regression model.
   - Built Random Forest, XGBoost, and LightGBM models.
   - Compared models using accuracy and ROC-AUC scores.

4. **Hyperparameter Tuning**
   - Optimized Random Forest using RandomizedSearchCV.

5. **Evaluation**
   - Used confusion matrix, classification report, accuracy score, and ROC-AUC score.

## ðŸ¤– Modeling
| Model | Accuracy | ROC-AUC |
|:------|:--------|:--------|
| Logistic Regression | Baseline | Baseline |
| Random Forest | Improved | Improved |
| XGBoost | High | High |
| LightGBM | High | High |

Random Forest performance improved significantly after hyperparameter tuning.

## ðŸš€ How to Run

1. Open and run the Jupyter Notebook (`Telco-Customer-Churn-Prediction.ipynb`).
2. Follow the notebook sequentially through preprocessing, EDA, modeling, and evaluation.
3. Modify hyperparameters or models to improve performance further if desired.

## ðŸŒŸ Future Improvements
- Feature selection using SHAP values.
- Model deployment using Flask and Docker.
- Real-time churn prediction API.
- Integrate Explainable AI (XAI) techniques for model transparency.
